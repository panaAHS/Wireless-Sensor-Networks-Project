# Wireless-Sensor-Networks-Project
This assignment was part of the course Applications of Telecommunication Devices (Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 8th semester). The purpose of the assignment is to design a wireless sensor network using Arduino UNO, low cost sensors and the ALOHA protocol.

#### Project description

The following sensors were used to measure the desired characteristics:
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Ranging Sensors
- Led Matrix 8x8 Red with MAX7219
- FSRs
- Servomotors
- Touch sensors
- Bluetooth module HC05

The ALOHA protocol was used for wireless communication between network nodes. The ALOHA protocol is a low-complexity contention-based communication protocol.
